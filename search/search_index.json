To use SciPy's SLSQP, we will need to supply it with custom objective and constraint functions as well as the derivatives for each.

I changed the name to OptVL for two reasons 1. There were many other pyAVLs and people who were looking for it had trouble finding it 2. I added lots of optimization features and wanted the name to reflect this development. While I changed the name, I decided to also make some changes to the API to better match AVL's interface.  The table below lists the changes.</p> pyAVL Method OptVL Equivalent Method <code>get_case_total_data</code> <code>get_total_forces()</code> <code>get_case_coef_derivs</code> <code>get_control_stab_derivs</code> <code>get_case_stab_derivs</code> <code>get_stab_derivs</code> <code>get_case_surface_data</code> <code>get_surface_forces</code> <code>get_case_parameter</code> <code>get_parameter</code> <code>set_case_parameter</code> <code>set_parameter</code> <code>get_case_constraint</code> <code>get_constraint</code> <code>get_strip_data</code> <code>get_strip_forces</code> <code>add_constraint</code> split into <code>set_constraint</code>, <code>set_variable</code>, <code>set_control_deflection</code> <code>add_trim_condition</code> <code>set_trim_condition</code> <code>executeRun</code> use <code>execute_run</code> instead <p>The output dictionaries for stability and control surface derivatives are also now flat.  For example, instead of <code>cs_derivs['CL']['Elevator']</code> the key is now <code>cs_derivs['dCL/dElevator']</code>.</p>"},{"location":"sectional_data_viz/","title":"Sectional Data","text":"<p>Like AVL, OptVL can also plot data about each chordwise section.  This data is useful for visualizing the force distribution along the wing among other things.  In contrast to AVL's integrated plotter, we return the data and allow you to plot it anyway you wish. In this demo we use <code>matplotlib</code> as it by far the most common package for plotting in Python. </p>"},{"location":"sectional_data_viz/#plotting-the-data","title":"Plotting the data","text":"<p>To get the data, just call the <code>ovl.get_strip_forces()</code> method.

The twist of our baseline design is all zero, but we have some variation in the chord that you can see on the plot:  </p> <p>One of the most useful things to look at is how the lift is distributed over the wing at our analysis condition.  Just like AVL, you can plot the CL and the CL perpendicular to the wing of the aircraft. The lift distribution is found by multiplying the CL at each section by the chord/cref. </p> <p>You can also look at how each section contributes to the overall roll and yaw moment coefficients.

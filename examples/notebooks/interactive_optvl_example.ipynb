    "### Introduction\n",
    "This notebook provides an interactive example of using OptVL, an aerodynamic analysis tool based on AVL (Athena Vortex Lattice). We will explore how basic geometric parameters of a wing affect its lift distribution. You'll be able to use sliders to change the wing's chord, twist, and span (which influences aspect ratio) and see the aerodynamic results updated in real-time.\n",
    "\n",
    "This example is aimed at senior undergraduate students in Aerospace Engineering. Some familiarity with basic aerodynamic concepts is assumed, but extensive Python knowledge is not required to run and interact with the notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Objectives:**\n",
    "- Demonstrate loading an aircraft geometry into OptVL.\n",
    "- Show how to modify geometric parameters programmatically.\n",
    "- Illustrate running an aerodynamic analysis.\n",
    "- Visualize results (lift distribution and geometry) interactively using Matplotlib and ipywidgets."

    "Before we dive into modifying the geometry, let's briefly review the key parameters we'll be adjusting:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **Chord:** The length of the wing section from the leading edge to the trailing edge. Changing the chord directly affects the wing area and thus the lift generated.\n",
    "-   **Twist (Angle of Incidence):** The angle at which a wing section is set relative to a reference plane (often the root chord's angle). Geometric twist refers to a variation in the angle of incidence along the span. Twisting a wing (e.g., \"washout,\" where the tip is at a lower angle of incidence than the root) can alter the spanwise lift distribution, potentially reducing lift at the tips to delay stall or modify induced drag.\n",
    "-   **Span & Aspect Ratio (AR):**\n",
    "    -   **Span (b):** The distance from one wingtip to the other.\n",
    "    -   **Aspect Ratio (AR):** A measure of how long and slender a wing is. It's defined as AR = b^2 / S, where S is the wing area. For a rectangular wing, AR = b / c (where c is the chord). High aspect ratio wings (like on gliders) are generally more aerodynamically efficient at subsonic speeds (lower induced drag), while low aspect ratio wings are common on fighter jets. In this notebook, changing the \"Span Factor\" will directly alter the span, and consequently, the aspect ratio.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **lift distribution** shows how the lift is distributed along the wingspan. An elliptical lift distribution is theoretically optimal for minimizing induced drag on an untwisted wing. Modifying chord and twist will change the shape of this distribution."

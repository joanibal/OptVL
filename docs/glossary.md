# Glossary of Terms

This glossary provides definitions for terms relevant to OptVL, Athena Vortex Lattice (AVL), aerospace engineering, Python, and optimization. It's aimed at helping undergraduate aerospace engineers or those new to some of these fields.

## A

**Adjoint Method**
:   An advanced mathematical technique used to efficiently calculate the derivatives (sensitivities) of a function (e.g., an objective function like drag) with respect to a large number of input parameters (design variables). It is particularly useful in gradient-based optimization. OptVL uses this for some derivative calculations.

**Aerodynamic Center**
:   The point on an airfoil or wing about which the pitching moment coefficient does not change with changes in angle of attack (for subsonic, attached flow).

**Airfoil**
:   The cross-sectional shape of a wing, blade (propeller, rotor, or turbine), or sail. Its design is a primary factor in determining aerodynamic performance.

**Angle of Attack (Alpha, α)**
:   The angle between the oncoming free-stream airflow (relative wind) and a reference line on an airfoil or wing, typically the chord line. It is a primary factor in determining lift, drag, and pitching moment.

**Aspect Ratio (AR)**
:   A dimensionless parameter that describes the shape of a wing. It is defined as the square of the wingspan divided by the wing area (AR = b²/Sref). High aspect ratio wings are long and slender (like a glider's), while low aspect ratio wings are short and stubby (like a fighter jet's).

**AVL (Athena Vortex Lattice)**
:   A widely used open-source program developed by Mark Drela and Harold Youngren at MIT for aerodynamic and flight dynamic analysis of aircraft. AVL uses a vortex lattice method (VLM) for its calculations. OptVL is built upon and extends AVL's capabilities.

## B

**Baseline Design**
:   An initial design point that serves as a reference for comparison during an optimization process or design exploration. Improvements are measured relative to the baseline.

**Beta (Sideslip Angle, β)**
:   The angle between the aircraft's longitudinal axis (centerline) and the oncoming free-stream airflow, projected onto the aircraft's x-y plane. A non-zero sideslip angle indicates that the aircraft is flying slightly sideways.

**Boundary Conditions**
:   In numerical simulations (like CFD or VLM), these are constraints applied at the edges of the computational domain (e.g., the surface of an airfoil, far-field conditions) that are necessary to obtain a unique solution to the governing equations.

**Bounds (in optimization)**

**Constraint (in optimization)**

**Convergence (in optimization)**
:   The state reached by an optimization algorithm where it has found a solution that meets the specified termination criteria, and further iterations produce little to no improvement in the objective function or satisfaction of constraints.

## D

**Degrees of Freedom (DOF)**
:   The number of independent parameters or variables that can be changed in a system or model. In aircraft flight dynamics, this often refers to the six degrees of freedom: three translational (surge, sway, heave) and three rotational (roll, pitch, yaw).

**Design Variable**
:   A parameter of a system that an optimizer is allowed to change to achieve an objective. Examples include wing span, airfoil shape parameters, or angle of attack.

**Derivative (Sensitivity)**
:   The rate of change of a function (e.g., an output like CL or CD) with respect to a change in one of its input variables (e.g., angle of attack or a design variable). Derivatives are crucial for gradient-based optimization algorithms. OptVL can calculate these sensitivities.

**Trim / Trimmed Flight**
:   A state of flight where the net pitching moment on the aircraft is zero, meaning there is no tendency for the aircraft to pitch up or down on its own. This is often achieved by adjusting control surfaces like the elevator. An aircraft is in "trimmed flight" when all net forces and moments are zero, resulting in steady, unaccelerated flight.

**Twist (Wing)**
